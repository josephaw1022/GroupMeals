# GroupMeal UI Application 

### Description

- We have to make a lot of decisions on a routine basis and one of the most annoying things at times can be not knowing what to eat. Sometimes, I wish that someone would just pick for me so that I don't have to eat any blame for anyone who may or may not complain. Well this is where GroupMeal comes in. This is a group or for single use meal choosing application for helping a person or a group of people choose a meal. This can used for a family, group of coworkers, or just some friends who eat out together routinely.
